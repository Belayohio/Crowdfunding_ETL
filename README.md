# Crowdfunding_ETL

For this project in the bootcamp, we were tasked with building an ETL pipeline using Pandas, Python using a dictionary method or Python using regular expressions to extract and trasnfrom the data.
We then in Python cleaned the data and put the data into a csv file where we then had to upload these into our postgres database in order to make a database. 
In postgres we imported our schema and loaded in all the csv data into the schema so that it would become a database.
